# App should be on Playstore.

# Change applicationId to YOUR_PLAY_STORE_APP_ID (package name of hosted app) under app module's build.gradle.

# Android devices >= Android 5.0 (API level 21) that have the Google Play Store installed.
```

### FAQ ü§î
```
# If you have already given rating in the past, in-app dialog will not show up. Sign-in with different account in play store and try again.

# Due to quota limitations, calling a launchReviewFlow method might not always display a dialog. It should not be linked with any button click event.
